I'm a scientist and engineer currently based in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.

Currently, I work as a Data Scientist at [Connecterra B.V](https://connecterra.io),
a dairy-tech scale up in Amsterdam. Previously I used to be a researcher at
the [CWI](https://www.cwi.nl) Amsterdam and the
[TAU](https://tao.lri.fr/tiki-index.php) group in INRIA
Paris-Saclay.

During my PhD days, my research interests broadly covered machine learning
applications in physical systems. I am interested
in all the interesting problems that fall in between,
such as, forecasting, simulation, uncertainty quantification,
and system identification.

In my free time, I enjoy literature; fiction and (sometimes)
non-fiction, and expanding my horizons with music from
around the world.
