I'm a scientist and engineer currently based in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.

Currently, I work as a Data Scientist at [Connecterra B.V](https://connecterra.io),
a dairy-tech scale up in Amsterdam. During my current tenure, I gained valuable experience 
in:

  - End-to-end machine learning:
    * Analysis, prototying and proof of concept for new models / services.
    * Building ML experimentation software stacks.
    * Large scale data preparation and model evaluation pipelines, going beyond text-book metrics.
    * Engineering real-time services serving ML models.
  - `tinyML` model optimisations such as quantisation, enabling power savings on edge deployments.

Previously I used to be a researcher at the [CWI](https://www.cwi.nl) Amsterdam 
and the [TAU](https://tao.lri.fr/tiki-index.php) group at the INRIA Paris-Saclay. 
During my PhD days, my research interests broadly covered machine learning
applications in physical systems. I am interested
in all the interesting problems that fall in between,
such as, forecasting, simulation, uncertainty quantification,
and system identification.

In my free time, I enjoy literature; fiction and (sometimes)
non-fiction, and expanding my horizons with music from
around the world.
